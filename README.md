# BidFoundry

An Adversarial Agentic Swarm system for generating high-quality government contracting strategy documents. The system uses a red team/blue team approach where multiple AI agents debate and challenge each other to produce comprehensive business strategy documents.

## Target Users

- Small businesses (< 500 employees) pursuing government contracts
- Companies new to GovCon (government contracting)
- Business development and capture teams

## Document Types Generated

- Capability Statements
- Competitive Analysis
- SWOT Analysis
- BD Pipeline Plans
- Proposal Strategy Outlines
- Go-to-Market Strategies
- Teaming Strategies

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (for backend)
- **Node.js 18+** (for frontend)
- **Anthropic API Key** (required for AI agents)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your API key:

```bash
# Required - Anthropic API Key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Server Configuration
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
DEBUG=true
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000

# Database (SQLite by default)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./data/swarm.db

# Export Configuration
EXPORT_TEMP_DIR=./data/exports
MAX_EXPORT_SIZE_MB=50
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
python run_server.py
python -m uvicorn server.main:app --host localhost --port 8000 --reload
```

The backend will be available at:
- **REST API**: http://localhost:8000/api
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:8000/ws

### 3. Start the Frontend Development Server

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at: http://localhost:5173

## API Key Configuration

### Anthropic API Key (Required)

The system uses Anthropic's Claude models for all AI agent reasoning. You need a valid Anthropic API key.

**Where to get it:**
1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Create a new API key

**Where to place it:**

| Location | Variable | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `.env` (root) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Main configuration file |

The API key is read by the agent system in [agents/config.py](agents/config.py) which sets:
- Default model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- Environment variable: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Frontend Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws
VITE_MOCK_API=false
```

These default values work out of the box for local development.

## Running Both Servers

### Development Mode

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
python run_server.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Alternative Backend Start Methods

```bash
# Direct uvicorn with hot reload
uvicorn server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Production mode (no reload)
uvicorn server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Production Frontend Build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build      # Creates production build in dist/
npm run preview    # Preview the production build
```

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand |
| Backend | FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic |
| Database | SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (production) |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) |
| Real-time | WebSocket for agent streaming |
| Document Export | python-docx, reportlab, markdown |

---

## How It Works

The system uses an adversarial multi-agent workflow:

1. **Blue Team Build** - Blue team agents (Strategy Architect, Market Analyst, etc.) generate initial document drafts
2. **Red Team Attack** - Red team agents (Devil's Advocate, Competitor Simulator, etc.) critique and challenge the draft
3. **Blue Team Defense** - Blue team responds to critiques and strengthens the document
4. **Synthesis** - The Arbiter agent synthesizes all inputs into the final output

Real-time updates are streamed via WebSocket, allowing users to watch the "debate" between agents.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed: `python --version`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check that `.env` file exists with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set

### Frontend won't connect to backend

1. Ensure backend is running on port 8000
2. Check CORS settings in `.env`: `CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173`
3. Verify WebSocket URL in frontend matches backend

### API Key errors

1. Verify your Anthropic API key is valid
2. Ensure no extra whitespace in the `.env` file
3. Check that the key starts with `sk-ant-`

### Database errors

1. Ensure the `data/` directory exists
2. For fresh start, delete `data/swarm.db` and restart server
